## Date script

This is a very simple date script that prints the current date and time.

This is containerized and [published on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sallallas/datescript).

All you need is docker image. Just upload and run it.

(First, I tried to publish my own ready projects, but practically all of them are graphical and require some display info.
Maven, jfx and all other stuff went well, but using correct display settings can't be done via only dockerfile, as it sets requirements for users machine too.
On Telegram, it was recommended not to use graphical projects here, so I did this this way instead as main thing is just to publish own image on Docker hub.)
